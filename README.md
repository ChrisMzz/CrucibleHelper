# CrucibleHelper

[Crucible](https://github.com/RoboPhred/potioncraft-crucible) is a modding framework for Potion Craft. It allows the creation of custom ingredients, NPCs and more and is designed to be usable with little to no programming experience. Users only need to provide images and write a YAML file. However, some aspects of this can be tedious as the framework is new, so CrucibleHelper attempts to give a bit of visibility on what the YAML file contains.

## Ingredients

Currently, CrucibleHelper only supports ingredients, and even this is still in early development.
An example file is provided, using the [JK New Ingredients](https://www.nexusmods.com/potioncraftalchemistsimulator/mods/18) mod.

As of time of writing, you need to install the mod to be able to view the results. I will update when the results are worth showing.
